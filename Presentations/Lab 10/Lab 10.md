# What is monitoring?
### RAM, CPU, Storage

???

So far, we've covered how to build things:
- start a managed server (Lab 3)
- serve HTTP requests
- build ML models

So suppose you join a startup, and the product explodes in popularity.

Has anyone heard of the Reddit Hug of Death?
- a site gains exposure on Reddit
- traffic from Reddit overloads the service
- site goes down, "killing it"

Monitoring is how you see that coming.
It's watching your server (computer) for overloaded CPU, RAM, storage.
- With your laptop, this is obvious, with servers less so.

Monitoring involves
- gathering information about the thing you're monitoring
- sending that information to you
- displaying that data

This is similar to a baby monitor, which has 
- a camera and 
- a live stream
- a device to watch the stream on
