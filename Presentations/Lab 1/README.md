# Lab 1
The first lab is divided into 3 major portions:
1. Class Admin
   - How to submit labs?
   - When are labs due?
2. Linux
   - Why are we using Linux?
   - How will you set up Linux?
3. Git
   - Why do we use Git?
   - How do you use Git?

This is a lot of information! I recommend we split this into 2 portions
1. Admin, Linux
   - Deliver these 2 presentations at the top of the first hour
   - Let students begin with VM setup
2. Git
   - Deliver this presentation at the top of the second hour
   - Let students continue with VM setup
