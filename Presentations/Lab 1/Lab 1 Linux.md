You probably recognize Windows and macOS, but when I started school, I did not know Linux.

# What is Linux?

???

Like the other 2, Linux is an operating system. 
- it manages hardware like CPUs, USB Ports, and WiFi modems
- it lets programmers (like you) write software that doesn't think too hard about the hardware

# Why Linux?
### Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft

???

We may not see Linux as users, but developers should be familiar with it. 
- it's overwhelmingly the Operating System of web servers
- it's used by all these companies, and they employ engineers to maintain Linux systems

Why is Linux so popular?
- Open Source â€“ code is available for free to anyone
- No licensing fees: great for profits
- Community maintained: lets you benefit from bug fixes (e.g. OpenSSL)

# Using Linux
### The Shell

???

Using Linux can be challenging:
- You'll need to use a "command prompt", which is a text based interface.
- Different from the Graphical User Interfaces (macOS and windows)

Why use the shell?
- Often the only way
- Reliable and fast
  - especially for "low spec" machines that might struggle to render a GUI
  - fast over bad network connections

As the name "command prompt" implies, the shell is how you tell the computer to do things:
- previously, it might be "run my C program" (CS103, EE109)
- now, it will be more complicated
  - ideally, you'll learn to look at, move, copy, and delete files
