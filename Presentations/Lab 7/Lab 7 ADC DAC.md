Analog: 
- continuous in quantity (voltage)
- continuous in time

Digital: 
- discrete in quantity (few bits)
- discrete in time

Our strategy: sample the analog periodically, to create a digital signal.

That leaves the question: given some voltage at some instant in time, how do we get bits out of it?
